1.intro_to_coding
	1.1 Interest
		1.1 are you interested in coding
			if yes
			1.1.1 proceed to step 1.2
			if no
			1.1.1 stop your done here
			if else
			1.1.1 google coding
			1.1.2 see if you like
			1.1.3 you're interested move to step 1.2
	1.2 research
		1.2.1 google coding schools
		1.2.2 see if any programs are what you like
		1.2.3 see Turing try coding event on Facebook
		1.2.4 sign up and proceed to step 1.3
	1.3 try coding
		1.3.1 get there
		1.3.2 back end
		1.3.3 front end
		1.3.4 talk to faculty during free lunch
	1.4 do you like coding
		if yes then
		1.4.1 pick Turing
		1.4.2 proceed to step 2
		if no
		1.4.1 you are done here
		if else
		1.4.1 repeat step 1.2

2.apply
	2.1 find Turing application
	2.2 fill it out
	2.3 take logic assessment
	2.4 did you get in
		if yes
		2.4.1 move to step 3
		if no
		2.4.1 do you want to give up
			if yes
			2.4.1.1 you are done here
			if no
			2.4.1.1try again
3.acceptance
	3.1 select cohort
	3.2 select mod 0
4.mod 0
	4.1 session 1

	4.6 session 6
		4.6.1 take survey
	4.7 did you pass mod0
		if yes
		4.7.1 move to step 5
		if no
		4.7.1 repeat step 4
		if else
		4.7.1 fix work repeat step 4.7
